							<p>Hi, it's me, Rahul Jindal. You may or may not know me, but either way, thanks for taking your time to check out my website.
								To get things started, let me tell you a little bit about myself.
								Let's start off with the basic information such as I was born on June 13, 2006, in India,
								and I currently reside in Canada. I'm an honours student that currently goes to Jean Augustine Secondary School attending the 12th Grade.
								My career goal is to become an esteemed Software Engineer, as I've always loved coding since my youth. The skill-set that I have also allows me to be qualified
								for this field such as the knowledge I have on C++, Java, & Python.
								The current short-term goal that I have is to get into a university that I believe will help me advance my skill-set in the future, and put my experiences/skills
								to good use. My long-term goal is to help others around the world by creating various programs in the future, and pass on the knowledge.

							<p>Now that I've given you some general information, let me tell you more about my hobbies and interests. I find music to be a relaxing and soothing sensation that helps me cheer up,
								therefore, I listen to all genres of music on a daily, and sometimes, immerse myself into music by playing the guitar or ukulele. I love painting on the side
								with my sister, spending quality time with her to go out on hikes, trails, and other adventures. I share a passion for swimming and playing meditating, as I like to meditate in early mornings,
								and I have done swimming on the side. I love going on early morning jogs, and going to the gym daily to ensure that I have clear mind throughout the day, and ensure that my health is prioritized.
								I'm in many sports clubs as well such as badminton club, table tennis club, and I also love playing tennis or soccer on the side as I find it enjoyable. I'm also part of others clubs besides the athletic
								ones such as I am part of the coding association of the school, and an executive for the mock trial club. I also love making side projects and learning more coding on the side. I've excelled in time management throughout the years,
								and I've learnt not to take more than I can handle. Throughout my life, one skill that I was never able to excel at my communication, however, through hard work and dedication I was able to master my way with words.
								During middle school, I was part of the speech eloquence competition, in which I was selected to represent the entire school.

										<h1>Connect 4</h1>
										<h2>This project was developped in order to create a connect 4 bot that could theoretically always win.
											To do this, I implemented a depth limited minimax algorithm. This algorithm strategically calculates which move leads to the most success by figuring out
											what move you are most likely to make. You can play the game <a href="https://rahuljindal2006.github.io/Connect4/"></a> </h2>

										<h1>Sudoku Solver</h1>
										<h2>By utilizing a backtracking approach and AC3 algorithm, I was able to create a sudoku solver that solves puzzles in just a few miliseconds.
											The AC3 algorithm is in place to maintain arc consistency with all the constraints, and reduce the domain size of all the variables before the
											search begins. By incorporating this algorithm, I was able to reduce solve time by almost 50% when comparing it to a normal backtracking algorithm. Feel free to test out the program by cloning it on my GitHub.<h2>

										<h1>My Website</h1>
										<h2>In order to increase my exposure to computer programming, and to challenge my creativity and coding skills, I decided to make a website of my own.
											My goal was to create a platform that displayed everything that I accomplished and more.
											Other than that, this project is pretty self-explanatory, since you are looking right at it.</h2>
